# Phase 1: ACP Discovery And Capability Map - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-04-22
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Planning synthesis from project initialization and follow-up review

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

This phase exists to learn what OpenCode actually exposes through ACP before Signal Foundry freezes a higher-level integration model.

The deliverable is not a production-grade multi-backend abstraction. The deliverable is a validated capability map, a reusable probe harness, and an updated project direction based on observed ACP behavior.

## Implementation Decisions

### Integration scope
- OpenCode is the only external coding agent backend in scope for this phase.
- ACP is the protocol boundary to investigate.
- The phase should prefer an experiment harness that can be re-run over one-off manual testing.

### Product shaping
- Do not finalize the long-term agent taxonomy in this phase.
- Treat "general agent" and "coding agent" as working categories only.
- Use OpenCode findings to decide which parts of the future configuration model are general and which are ACP-specific.

### Discovery goals
- Validate the ACP lifecycle Signal Foundry needs most: initialize, session creation, prompt execution, progress updates, cancellation, and session resume if available.
- Capture actual OpenCode capabilities returned at runtime instead of assuming optional ACP features are supported.
- Record unsupported or unclear features as explicit non-goals for the first implementation slice.

### Implementation shape
- Keep the experiment harness in-repo so future phases can reuse it.
- Prefer Go for the probe tooling to match the existing repo and test patterns.
- Extend `tests/agent/integration-cli` instead of creating a separate ACP test project, so successful experiments become the basis of long-term integration testing.

### The agent's Discretion
- Exact package layout for ACP-specific code inside `tests/agent/integration-cli`.
- Exact file names for experiment transcripts and capability-map docs, as long as they are stable and discoverable.

- `tests/AGENTS.md` - integration test expectations and manual setup stance
- `tests/agent/integration-cli/main.go` - existing Go CLI pattern for agent testing
- `tests/agent/integration-cli/cli.go` - existing runner invocation pattern

### Domain vocabulary

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Probe OpenCode via `opencode acp` over JSON-RPC stdio.
- Capture raw request/response and notification transcripts so Signal Foundry can reason about exact protocol behavior later.
- Check capability negotiation before assuming support for `session/load`, `session/list`, or `session/close`.
- Focus on the smallest validated ACP subset Signal Foundry needs for its first OpenCode integration.

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Support for additional coding backends beyond OpenCode
- Final naming for agent categories
- UI or marketplace work for agent configuration
- Broader ACP surface area not exercised by this phase

</deferred>
