# Phase 2: Agent Profile Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-04-22
**Status:** Ready for planning
**Source:** Planning synthesis from roadmap, Phase 1 findings, and current runtime architecture

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

This phase exists to define agent profiles as durable first-class data without baking ACP or OpenCode details into the general model too early.

The deliverable is a general profile schema, persistence support, and a control-plane surface to create, edit, and load saved profiles. It is not yet the backend-specific OpenCode execution lane.

## Implementation Decisions

### Profile boundary
- Agent profiles must stay general and backend-agnostic in this phase.
- Store role, instructions, selected tool references, and Signal Foundry-owned execution settings only.
- Do not store ACP or OpenCode connection details in the general profile shape.

### Phase 1 carry-forward
- Build Phase 2 around the validated ACP subset only: `initialize`, `session/new`, `session/prompt`, and `session/update`.
- Treat cancellation, session resume, session listing, session close, MCP injection behavior, and slash-command guarantees as deferred backend-specific concerns.

### Architecture shape
- Keep durable agent-profile data in `runtime/internal`, parallel to provider config and session storage patterns.
- Reuse the existing file-vs-database storage selector under `agentRuntime` instead of introducing a separate persistence switch.
- Keep `runtime/httpapi` thin and extend the spec-first `runtime/internal/agentapi` layer if profile CRUD is exposed over HTTP.
- Keep `apps/signal-foundry` responsible for choosing implementations, wiring services, and mounting the runtime API, not for owning profile persistence logic.

### The agent's Discretion
- Exact profile field names and whether the primary identifier is immutable `name` or another stable key.
- Exact validation depth for tool references, as long as the first slice does not rely on an unimplemented tool-catalog API.
- Exact doc artifact name for the phase's durable schema contract.

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Prefer a new `runtime/internal/agentprofiles` package mirroring the existing provider-config architecture.
- Reuse file and database implementations so saved profiles survive restart in the same storage mode already selected for runtime state.
- Keep tool references lightweight for the first slice, because the runtime does not yet expose a stable tool-catalog API.
- Capture the Phase 2 schema boundary in a durable implementation doc so Phase 3 can add ACP/OpenCode bindings without redefining the general profile contract.

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- OpenCode- or ACP-specific connection details inside the core profile
- Storage of remote session identifiers, capability flags, `cwd`, or `mcpServers`
- User-facing cancellation, session resume, or session listing guarantees
- The actual ACP-backed coding-agent launch path targeted by Phase 3
