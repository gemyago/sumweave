# Phase 2 Plan 02: Agent Profile CRUD Runtime Surface Summary

**Runtime now exposes full saved-agent-profile CRUD over `/agent-profiles` with generated OpenAPI bindings and service-backed handler implementations.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 14 min
- **Started:** 2026-04-22T18:36:01Z
- **Completed:** 2026-04-22T18:50:56Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 18

## Accomplishments

- Added OpenAPI contract + generated bindings for `GET/POST /agent-profiles` and `GET/PUT/DELETE /agent-profiles/{profileName}`.
- Implemented internal profile mapper/handlers with domain-to-HTTP error mapping and problem-details responses.
- Kept public wrapper thin by requiring and forwarding `AgentProfilesService` through `runtime/httpapi`.
- Added CRUD tests (success + malformed JSON + validation + conflict + not-found + server-error) and dependency validation tests.

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Extend runtime OpenAPI contract for agent profile CRUD** - `eb7b970` (`feat`)
2. **Task 2: Implement profile handlers and thin HTTP wrapper wiring** - `872144f` (`feat`)
3. **Task 2 follow-up fixes (verification blockers)** - `03c1f7b` (`fix`)

## Files Created/Modified

- `runtime/internal/agentapi/openapi.yaml` - Added profile CRUD paths, params, and schemas.
- `runtime/internal/agentapi/api.gen.go` - Regenerated bindings/routes/types for profile endpoints.
- `runtime/internal/agentapi/agent_profile_mapper.go` - Maps domain profile model <-> API DTOs.
- `runtime/internal/agentapi/agent_profile_handlers.go` - CRUD handlers using `AgentProfilesService`.
- `runtime/internal/agentapi/agent_profile_handlers_test.go` - CRUD and error-path tests.
- `runtime/internal/agentapi/server.go` - Added required profile service dependency.
- `runtime/httpapi/handler.go` - Added required profile service validation/wiring.
- `runtime/httpapi/handler_test.go` - Added nil profile-service dependency test.
- `apps/signal-foundry/internal/runtime.go` - Wired profile service into app runtime handler construction.
- `runtime/AGENTS.md` - Documented profile CRUD HTTP surface and required service dependency.

## Decisions Made

- Reused existing problem-details response helper for profile CRUD errors to keep API error format uniform.
- Kept `name` immutable by using path param identity and excluding it from update schema/body.
- Used app-level profile service wiring instead of relaxing handler dependency guarantees.

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Added app runtime wiring for new required profile dependency**
- **Found during:** Task 2 verification (`make affected-lint-test`)
- **Issue:** `apps/signal-foundry` runtime tests failed because `httpapi.NewHandler` now requires `AgentProfilesService`.
- **Fix:** Added `newAgentProfilesService` in app runtime and passed service into `httpapi.HandlerArgs`.
- **Files modified:** `apps/signal-foundry/internal/runtime.go`
- **Verification:** `apps/signal-foundry` tests pass in `make affected-lint-test`.
- **Committed in:** `03c1f7b`

**2. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Raised handler coverage/formatting to satisfy runtime gates**
- **Found during:** Task 2 verification (`runtime:lint` / `runtime:test`)
- **Issue:** New handler test file failed `golines`, and file-level coverage for `agent_profile_handlers.go` was below threshold.
- **Fix:** Reformatted long test lines and added missing 500-path tests for list/get/delete profile handlers.
- **Files modified:** `runtime/internal/agentapi/agent_profile_handlers_test.go`
- **Verification:** `cd runtime && make lint && make test` pass.
- **Committed in:** `03c1f7b`

**3. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Adjusted signal-foundry lint directives to clear affected lint gate**
- **Found during:** Repository completion verification
- **Issue:** `signal-foundry:lint` failed on `ireturn`/`nolintlint` directive placement conflicts in telemetry constructors.
- **Fix:** Updated directive placement for multi-line signatures and synchronized DI helper directive usage.
- **Files modified:** `apps/signal-foundry/internal/telemetry/otel*.go`, `apps/signal-foundry/internal/di/dig.go`
- **Verification:** `cd apps/signal-foundry && make lint` and full `make affected-lint-test` pass.
- **Committed in:** `03c1f7b`

---

**Total deviations:** 3 auto-fixed (3 blocking)
**Impact on plan:** All fixes were required to complete verification with no contract regressions.

## Issues Encountered

- `oapi-codegen` emits an OpenAPI 3.1 support warning; generation still succeeded and produced expected routes/types.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Profile CRUD contract and runtime surface are complete and verified.
- Ready for Phase 2 Plan 03 consumer-side integration and UX flows.

## Self-Check: PASSED
